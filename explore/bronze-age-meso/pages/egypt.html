    <h2>Egypt before Pharaohs</h2>
    <p>What is one of the first things you think about when you hear Ancient Egypt? Pyramids? Desert? Camals? If hopeful you thought of a Pharaoh! While those other things are important.
        The idea of a Pharaoh is <i>fundamental</i> to the Ancient Egyptian identity. But before we can talk about Pharaohs, we first must learn about Egypt <i>before</i> pharaohs.
    </p>
    <p>Egypt first began before 3000 BCE as a small collection of tribes along the <a>Nile River</a>, in Northern Africa. These tribes were lead by Chiefs, leading to many people calling these states Chiefdoms,
        or governments lead by Chiefs, kind off like a Kingdom but with a Chief instead of a king. These tribes were commonly at conflict with eachother and agreed with very little. Eventually
        two promate powers emgried at the Nile, <a>Upper Egypt</a> and <a>Lower Egypt</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upper Egypt was based in Thebes while Lower Egypt was based in Memphis. Oddly engough, Upper Egypt was to the South of Lower Egypt. This is because Upper Egypt was up the <i>
        the river</i> These two kingdoms were constantly at conflict with eachother. However, that would all change in 3150 BCE when King Narmer of Upper Egypt united the two kingdoms
        into one. Kingdom of Egypt, with Narmer as the first Pharaoh. Granted, historians debate wether or not it was peaceful... But, ya know, what works works.
    </p>
    <h2>Egyptian Administration and Reiligon</h2>
    <p>
        Now, if you sitting their wondering <i>how</i> Narmer was able unite these two kingdoms, we will have to look at how the government AND religon worked. You will soon realize
        that religon is also extermly important to not only the Ancient Egyptian people, but their politics as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Politics in Ancient Egypt is very different from the politics of today. I'd say that most of the people reading this live in a Republic, where the people elect the leaders 
        that they like the most tp rule over them. Of course it is more complictaed then that but, that is the basic idea. The people choose the leader they want because they think the 
        leader they <i>want</i> will be the <i>best</i> leader. In Egypt, the people did not decide the leaders, whoever has the <i>right</i> to rule, would. Like you are reading this 
        on a device, probably a computer, that either belongs to you or someone close to you. The same way this computer belongs to to its owner, Egypt belonged to the rightful Pharaoh.
        "And why do they have the right to rule Egypt?" you may ask. The answer is simple: <b>They are a god</b>. The Egyptians believed that the Pharaohs were the human manifestation of 
        the god Horus, a god that commonly repersents kingship and shows its self as an eagle. If you are Christain, then think of the Pharaohs like Jesus. The god came down to the Earth 
        to rule over the people, because God knows best, certainly better then any human. They had the right to rule, you could say that this right is divine, a Divine Right.
    </p>
    <p>
        Divine Right is a jusification for an autocratic rule, rule by one person. It goes as I just explained. A god or goddess has granted the right to rule in the hands of a person and
        therefor, is better prepared to rule. So when the ruler would die, then who rules the kingdom after? Well, if he was blessed, then his son would be blessed too, right? So the natural
        assumtion is that the son of the king would assume the throne as the old king died. If their was no son then the daughter, then the brothers, or sisters, or really any family member.
        This was called succession, who would <i>succeed</i> the king after he died. Now, succession was not always so easy. Sometimes there would be now close family members, or the only
        family member is cruel or incompetent, proving he might actually not be blessed by a god, so a powerful noble might try his luck to see if the rest of the court would support him becoming king, or in this case Pharaoh. Now, having the 
        oppertunity to become Pharaoh is nothing to cough at. So usually more then one noble would try their luck. And other nobles would support other nobles, causing a complicated succession.
        Usually these ended smoothly, but occasionally it didn't. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes no clear hier is in place, and many nobles all are completing over the throne. Occasionally it has came to violence. <a>Pretenders</a> would raise armies to try to
        press their claims as Pharaoh and take it by force. This may become too much for the government to handle, so it would fall apart. These periods were called "intermittent periods"
        and they seperated the 3 main Egyptian kingdoms, the Old Kingdom (the first), the Middle Kingdom (the second), and the New Kingdom (the last). The intermittent periods were periods 
        of anarchy, with rival factions would try to claim and hold the throne of Egypt. These periods of lawlessness could be over a hundred years long, until finally a noble family beats
        the rest and wins the Egyptian throne.
    </p>
    <h2>Egyptian Conquests and Dipomacy</h2>
    <p> Egypt's New Kingdom was known for rapid conquests. The two main domains it asserted its control over was Nubia and Cannan. Cannan was notable at the time because it was not really
        Egyptian. Cannan was a kingdom in modern day Isreal/Palestine, well it actually was not a kingdom. Like how Egypt was ruled by local Chiefs before it was united by Narmer, Cannan 
        the same way. It was a confederation of tribal states. They often fought with eachother but would band together to repeal an enemy. In this case the enemy was Ancient Egypt. In
        1458 BCE, Pharaoh Thutmose III of Egypt defeated a coalition of local Cannanite Chiefs at the Battle of Megiddo. The confederation had lost their power and Cannan was soon overrun 
        by Egypt. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why did Egypt conquer Cannan? Primary because Cannan was a vastly imporatant area for trade, it gave Egypt many a safe rout to the rest of the Middle East, and better trade.
        But that was not only the reason, Thutmose III used Cannan as a message to the rest of the Mesopotomia: <i>Don't Mess with Egypt</i>. This move made Egypt a great power in Mesopotomia\
        now it was no longer a isolated kingdom but a true empire that could conquer other civilizations. Now also remeber that conquering and annexing land back then was much harder for 
        governments now to handle then then. Any annextion was a long and difficult process that many kingdoms decided to aviod, like the Hitties.
